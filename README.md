# norsecraft
Norse mythology themed mod for minecraft


## Getting Started
> "Oh Eric, I wanna contribute to the mod but I don't know how" - You

0) Make sure you have Java 8 and Java Minecraft installed on your machine.

1) Install Eclipse (I hear IntelliJ will work but I don't even bother with that noise)

2) Open eclipse and make some empty workspace

3) Git clone Norsecraft into that empty workspace folder

4) Add the project as an existing gradle project in eclipse

5) In the gradle menu down load, gen the eclipse runs and run the eclipse task.  I think these two do different things and I don't think the order mattres.

6) Run it!  You might need to open your run configurations to see it, but you should now have RunClient, RunData, and RunServer.  Run that client and the minecraft game window should open up.  Click on the mods button and behold Norsecraft is installed.

7) [BONUS!!] -- Improve these docs if you're getting started for the first time!
